# CREATING CUSTOM GITHUB ACTIONS
---------------------------------
# why to create beself when there are heaps already in the marketplace for free ?
# Ans : you might want to simpify in your worklfow based on your own logic. This gives you more control on such actions for example publically available actions
requires to hadnle you workflow in multiple steps while your custom actions can do all that in a single go. contribute to the community.

There are three type of custom actions 
1.Javascript based 
  executes a js file 
  using nodejs or anyother package
  dependency on JS expertise
2.Docker based
  If you don't know JS then you use this option.
  Use any Programming language and use any base environment using a docker file.
  Provides greate flexibility.

3.Composte (mix of custom)
  Dont write code instead use existing workflow steps and combine them to one action as composite achieve certain outcomes.
Combination of run and uses commands that you already know from standard github actions are used.
No new programming language knowledge is required.

Refer to the syntaxt definition on the official githib documentation

Example : 

Need only one file : actions.yml

name: 'Get and Cache dependencies'
description: 'Get the dependenceis (via npm) and cache them'
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: Cache dependencies
      id: cache
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key:deps-note-modules-${{ hashFiles('')}}
    - name: Install dependencies
      if:steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
      run: npm ci
      shell: bash
