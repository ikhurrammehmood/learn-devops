# CREATING CUSTOM GITHUB ACTIONS
---------------------------------
# why to create beself when there are heaps already in the marketplace for free ?
# Ans : you might want to simpify in your worklfow based on your own logic. This gives you more control on such actions for example publically available actions
requires to hadnle you workflow in multiple steps while your custom actions can do all that in a single go. contribute to the community.

There are three type of custom actions 
1.Javascript based 
  executes a js file 
  using nodejs or anyother package
  dependency on JS expertise
2.Docker based
  If you don't know JS then you use this option.
  Use any Programming language and use any base environment using a docker file.
  Provides greate flexibility.

3.Composte (mix of custom)
  Dont write code instead use existing workflow steps and combine them to one action as composite achieve certain outcomes.
Combination of run and uses commands that you already know from standard github actions are used.
No new programming language knowledge is required.

Refer to the syntaxt definition on the official githib documentation

Example : Creating a new custom action
- Create a subfolder in your project to store local custom actions or else you wanna create and refer to the standalone repos.
  FOLDER - actions/cache-deps/actions.yml

Need only one file : actions.yml

name: 'Get and Cache dependencies'
description: 'Get the dependenceis (via npm) and cache them'
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: Cache dependencies
      id: cache
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key:deps-note-modules-${{ hashFiles('')}}
    - name: Install dependencies
      if:steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
      run: npm ci
      shell: bash

Example: calling / using your above created custom actions will be like any regulare steps in your Workflow
- Workflow name Deploy.yml

steps:
 - name: Install dependencies
   uses: ./.github/actions/cache-deps

Example : Adding Input variables to custom composite actions
- Go back to your action.yml file and add this code

name: 'Get and Cache dependencies'
description: 'Get the dependenceis (via npm) and cache them'
inputs:
  caching:
    description:'inputs to caching'
    required: false
    default: 'true'
runs:
  using: 'composite'
  steps:
    - name: Cache dependencies
      if: inputs.caching == true
      id: cache
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key:deps-note-modules-${{ hashFiles('')}}
    - name: Install dependencies
      if:steps.cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true' || inputs.caching != 'true'
      run: npm ci
      shell: bash

Example: Passing input variables value in the workflow to control different behaviiour for different steps
- Workflow name Deploy.yml

steps:
 - name: Install dependencies
   uses: ./.github/actions/cache-deps
   with:
    caching:false
