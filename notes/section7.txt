## Conditional workflow and job execution 
## if condition ; to run something when a condition is satisfied
## continue-on-error flag to to ignore errors , mark that step forcibly as completed and continue to next ones.
    - name: <some step name>
      continue-on-error: true
      id: runtesting
      run: npm run test


## built in functions for conditional logic are 
# failure() returns true if any step or job fails above
# success() returns true if everything before was sucessfull
# always() makes a step to alsways run even if its cancelled or previous ones are failed
# cancelled() retrurns true if the wf has been cancelled


# these can also be used in conjuction with other if conditons e.g
#
- name: dependency_test
  id: run-testing
  run:npm run test

- name: testreport
  if: failure() && steps.run-testing.outcome=='failure' -- here onyl this step will run not the next ones based on the conditions
  uses: action/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name:test-report
    path:test.json

# matrix job strategy 
# this is used to run same job on multiple configurations e.g linux and windows etc
# example code 

jobs:
   build: 
    continue-on-error:true
    strategy:
        matrix:
        node-version:[12 , 14, 16]
        operating-system:[ubuntu-latest,windows-latest]
