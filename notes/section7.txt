## Conditional workflow and job execution 
## if condition ; to run something when a condition is satisfied
## continue-on-error flag to to ignore errors


## built in functions for conditional logic are 
# failure() returns true if any step or job fails above
# success() returns true if everything before was sucessfull
# always() makes a step to alsways run even if its cancelled or previous ones are failed
# cancelled() retrurns true if the wf has been cancelled


# these can also be used in conjuction with other if conditons e.g
#
- name: dependency_test
  id: run-testing
  run:npm run test

- name: testreport
  if: failure() && steps.run-testing.outcome=='failure'
  uses: action/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name:test-report
    path:test.json
