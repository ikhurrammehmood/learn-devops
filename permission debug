The error message "Permission to GavinReid82/gitPractice.git denied to GavinReid82" typically indicates that there's an authentication problem.

Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):
Ensure that you have generated a new personal access token from GitHub. Follow these steps if you haven't done this yet:

Go to your GitHub Settings.
Navigate to Developer settings > Personal access tokens.
Click on Generate new token.
Select the necessary scopes, such as repo for full control of private repositories.
Copy the generated token.
Update Git Credentials:
Use the token as your password when performing Git operations that require authentication.

Open your terminal and run the following command to set the token as your credential:
git config --global credential.helper store
Then, try to push again. When prompted for a username, use your GitHub username. For the password, use the personal access token.
Clear Previous Credentials:
If you previously stored credentials that might be incorrect, you can clear them and re-enter the correct credentials.

On macOS, you can clear stored GitHub credentials using the following command:
git credential-osxkeychain erase
When prompted, enter the following:
protocol=https
host=github.com
Use HTTPS with the Token:
Ensure that your GitHub repository URL is set to use HTTPS:

Check your remote URL:
git remote -v
If it shows an SSH URL, you need to change it to HTTPS:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/GavinReid82/gitPractice.git
Verify Token in Keychain:
Since you mentioned updating your keychain, double-check that the personal access token is correctly stored in your keychain and associated with GitHub.

Re-clone the Repository:
If all else fails, sometimes re-cloning the repository with the new token can resolve any lingering issues:

Backup your changes.
Remove the current repository.
Clone the repository again using HTTPS and your new token:
git clone https://github.com/GavinReid82/gitPractice.git
After following these steps, try to push your changes again:

git push --set-upstream origin print_changes
