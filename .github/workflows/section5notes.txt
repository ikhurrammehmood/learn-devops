# caching the repetitive tasks such as installing the dependencies to avoid re running them for each job.
# this can be done by adding a step before the step/action that we need to cache by adding the following lines

  - name: Cache dependencies

    with:
      path: ~/.npm    #one or multiple paths that are required to be cached , refer to the official documnetation for code samples
